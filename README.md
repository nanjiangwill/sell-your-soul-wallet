# Sell-Your-Soul Wallet

This is an Arbitrum Hackathon project.

Sell-Your-Soul Wallet is a *tradable* smart contract wallet. Each wallet is
smart contract, whose ownership is represented as an ERC721 NFT, that is able
to interpret arbitrary contract calls.

Using it, users can sell any tokenized positions, on-chain game states, rights
to future airdrops, and any information that is associated with an Eth address
(i.e. SBTs) as an NFT.
